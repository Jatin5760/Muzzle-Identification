                    <p class="muted">
                        MuzzleID is built on a foundation of cutting-edge computer vision models, including Meta's 
                        Segment Anything 2 for precise muzzle segmentation and ResNet50 for robust feature extraction. 
                        This powerful combination allows us to create a unique digital fingerprint for each animal, 
                        ensuring unparalleled accuracy and reliability.
